## Description
This app was originally a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. The challenge was to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app is built using a MERN stack, React , MongoDB, Nodejs and Expressjs. The app lets you search for a specific book and it provides you the books with details and images.
